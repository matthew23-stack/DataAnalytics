# Module 1: The Basics of Data
What is Data Analytics?
The role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization.involves several key responsibilities and skills.Data Collection and Preparation:Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,Data Analysis:Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,Data Visualization and Storytelling:Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,Decision Support:Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,Continuous Learning and Adaptation:Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.A data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies, and create a competitive advantage.Professionals who possess the skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work.They understand how the organization can acquire, clean, and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
Data 
The amount of data the modern world generates on a daily basis is staggering. From the organized tables of spreadsheets to the storage of photos, video, and audio recordings, modern businesses create an almost overwhelming avalanche of data that is ripe for use in analytics programs.
Storage
The second key trend driving the growth of analytics programs is the increased availability of storage at rapidly decreasing costs.
Computing Power
Today, the effects of Moore's Law have democratized computing. Most employees in an organization now have enough computing power sitting on their desks to perform a wide variety of analytic tasks. If they require more powerful computing resources, cloud services allow them to rent massive banks of computers at very low cost. Even better, those resources are charged at hourly rates, and analysts pay only for the computing time that they actually use.
Career in Analytics
As businesses try to keep up with these trends, hiring managers find themselves struggling to identify, recruit, and retain talented analytics professionals.Data analysts and scientists,AI and machine learning (ML) specialists,Big Data specialists,Digital marketing and strategy specialists,Process automation specialists,Business development professionals,Digital transformation specialists,Information security analyst,Software and applications developers,Internet of Things (IoT) specialists.
The Analytics Process
Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data.

The Analytics Process is Iterative
While we describe the steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
Analytics Techniques
Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.help you understand the purpose of different types of analysis, we often group these techniques into categories based on the purpose of the analysis and/or the nature of the tool.
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
Machine learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future. here are some cases where machine learning commonly adds value:Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident.Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.Machine learning can bring value to almost every field where discovering previously unknown knowledge is useful.As we move through the world, we hear the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning being used almost interchangeably to describe any sort of technique where computers are working with data.Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. As the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent.Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.
Data Governance
Notice that there is a slab of stone that supports the three pillars of analytics. This slab represents the important role of data governance in analytics programs. Without strong governance, analytics programs cannot function effectively.Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.how organizations use master data management (MDM) programs to maintain and improve the quality of their data.
Analytics Tools
hese tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.Some of these tools are well-known to most computer users. For example, people are generally familiar with spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
Chapter 1 Summary ðŸ™Œ
Analytics programs allow businesses to access the untapped value locked within their data. Today, many organizations recognize the potential value of this work but are still in the early stages of developing their analytics programs. These programs, driven by the unprecedented availability of data, the rapidly decreasing cost of storage, and the maturation of cloud computing, promise to create significant opportunities for businesses and, in turn, for data professionals skilled in the tools and techniques of analytics.As analysts develop analytic work products, they generally move through a series of stages. Their work begins with the acquisition of data from internal and external sources and continues with the cleaning and manipulation of that data. Once data is in a suitable form, data professionals apply analytic techniques to draw conclusions from their data, create visualizations to depict the story of their data, and develop reports and dashboards to effectively communicate the results of their work to business leaders.

# Module 1: The Basics of Data
What is Data Analytics?🙌🙌
The role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization.involves several key responsibilities and skills.Data Collection and Preparation:Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,Data Analysis:Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,Data Visualization and Storytelling:Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,Decision Support:Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,Continuous Learning and Adaptation:Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.A data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies, and create a competitive advantage.Professionals who possess the skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work.They understand how the organization can acquire, clean, and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
Data ✨✨
The amount of data the modern world generates on a daily basis is staggering. From the organized tables of spreadsheets to the storage of photos, video, and audio recordings, modern businesses create an almost overwhelming avalanche of data that is ripe for use in analytics programs.
Storage🎂🎂
The second key trend driving the growth of analytics programs is the increased availability of storage at rapidly decreasing costs.
Computing Power✔✔
Today, the effects of Moore's Law have democratized computing. Most employees in an organization now have enough computing power sitting on their desks to perform a wide variety of analytic tasks. If they require more powerful computing resources, cloud services allow them to rent massive banks of computers at very low cost. Even better, those resources are charged at hourly rates, and analysts pay only for the computing time that they actually use.
Career in Analytics🎁🎁
As businesses try to keep up with these trends, hiring managers find themselves struggling to identify, recruit, and retain talented analytics professionals.Data analysts and scientists,AI and machine learning (ML) specialists,Big Data specialists,Digital marketing and strategy specialists,Process automation specialists,Business development professionals,Digital transformation specialists,Information security analyst,Software and applications developers,Internet of Things (IoT) specialists.
The Analytics Process👌👌
Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data.

The Analytics Process is Iterative
While we describe the steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
Analytics Techniques🐱‍🏍🐱‍🏍
Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.help you understand the purpose of different types of analysis, we often group these techniques into categories based on the purpose of the analysis and/or the nature of the tool.
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning🐱‍🚀🐱‍🚀
Machine learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future. here are some cases where machine learning commonly adds value:Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident.Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.Machine learning can bring value to almost every field where discovering previously unknown knowledge is useful.As we move through the world, we hear the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning being used almost interchangeably to describe any sort of technique where computers are working with data.Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. As the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent.Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.
Data Governance🐱‍🐉🐱‍🐉
Notice that there is a slab of stone that supports the three pillars of analytics. This slab represents the important role of data governance in analytics programs. Without strong governance, analytics programs cannot function effectively.Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.how organizations use master data management (MDM) programs to maintain and improve the quality of their data.
Analytics Tools🐱‍💻🐱‍💻
hese tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.Some of these tools are well-known to most computer users. For example, people are generally familiar with spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
Chapter 1 Summary 🙌
Analytics programs allow businesses to access the untapped value locked within their data. Today, many organizations recognize the potential value of this work but are still in the early stages of developing their analytics programs. These programs, driven by the unprecedented availability of data, the rapidly decreasing cost of storage, and the maturation of cloud computing, promise to create significant opportunities for businesses and, in turn, for data professionals skilled in the tools and techniques of analytics.As analysts develop analytic work products, they generally move through a series of stages. Their work begins with the acquisition of data from internal and external sources and continues with the cleaning and manipulation of that data. Once data is in a suitable form, data professionals apply analytic techniques to draw conclusions from their data, create visualizations to depict the story of their data, and develop reports and dashboards to effectively communicate the results of their work to business leaders.

# Chapter 2 Understanding Data 
To understand data types, it is best first to understand data elements. A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values. Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events. Now that you understand what data elements are, let's explore how they relate to data types. A data type limits the values a data element can have.Pet Name, Animal Type, and Breed Name are all words. Meanwhile, the Date of Birth column contains numbers and slashes that identify a specific date. Height and Weight are both numbers. Each of these groupings represents a particular data type.
Tabular Data🐱‍👤🐱‍👤
Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header. The intersection of a row and column contains a specific value. Looking at the intersection of Jack and Breed Name in Table 2.1 tells us that Jack is a Corgi. If we want to identify Hazel's breed, we look at where her row intersects with the Breed Name column and see that she is a Labradoodle.Spreadsheets, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers, are practical tools for representing tabular data. A relational database management system (RDMS), commonly called a database, extends the tabular model. Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables. The connection between tables is known as a relationship. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are examples of database software. Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases.
Structured Data Types🐬🐬
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/0e0d3780-0d06-45dd-8402-85c809c2d66d)
Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.When you read the column headings, you get a good sense of the kind of data that you're going to find in that column. For example, when you see the “Weight (pounds)” column, you expect to see numeric values. In the Address field, you expect to see text. Looking more closely, we see that the data values are consistent for each column.
Character
The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters.The alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units (SKUs). It is common in the retail clothing space to have a unique SKU for each item available for sale. If you sell jeans, you may stock products from Armani Jeans, Diesel, Lee Jeans, Levi's, and Wrangler. To keep track of all the manufacturer, size, color, and fit combinations in your inventory, you might use an SKU similar to the one depicted in Figure 2.2. Tracking inventory at the SKU level allows you to manage availability in your online and in-store systems, all courtesy of the alphanumeric data type.
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/c9f59bee-7905-46ab-aa7b-d21a48791d21)
There are times when it is necessary to impose even stricter limits on character-related data to exclude numbers. Excluding numbers can be achieved using the text data type.Consider a data entry example. Suppose you operate an online retail system. To deliver orders, you need address information for the intended recipients. This information comes from the customers themselves since they can specify where orders should be shipped.
Character Sets😁😁
When considering alphanumeric and text data types, you need to think about the character set you are using to input and store data when using a database. Databases use character sets to map, or encode, data and store it digitally. The ASCII encoding standard is based on the U.S. English alphabet. ASCII accommodates both the upper and lowercase English alphabet and numbers, mathematical operators, and symbols.Many languages include accent marks, extending the Latin alphabet. For example, Akrapovič is a Slovenian manufacturer. To store the č in Akrapovič, you need to encode that value appropriately. In addition, there are many languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which use symbols as opposed to extending the Latin alphabet. For example, the Arabic word for “cat.” Several encoding standards exist that accommodate non-Latin characters.
Numeric
When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute, numeric becomes the data type of choice. This data type appears to be simple and obvious based on its name. As seen with the character data type, implementation nuances about numeric are essential to understand. Databases accommodate two types of numeric data types: integer and numeric.
Whole Numbers
The integer, and all its subtypes, are for storing whole numbers. As seen with the character family of data types, implementation differences exist across databases. Table 2.3 illustrates how Oracle, Microsoft, and MySQL support whole numbers. Note that both the Microsoft and MySQL databases support the bit data type, which can be empty or store a 0 or a 1. In computer science, flags indicate whether something is on or off, or if a function has completed successfully. To show something is on, 1 or TRUE is used. For a value of off, 0 or FALSE is used. The bit data type is intended for storing the status of a flag. Note also that the value ranges for smallint and shortinteger are identical. The same is true for int and integer, as well as bigint and longinteger. Although the data types have different names, their functionality is equivalent.
Rational Numbers
In all its variants, the numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point. As with the integer family of data types, each database vendor has its implementation nuances. Table 2.4 illustrates how Oracle, Microsoft, and MySQL support rational numbers.
Date and Time
Gathered together under the broad category of date, day of year and time of day are data elements that appear with great frequency. As illustrated in Table 2.5, databases have various data types for handling date- and time-related information. As seen with character and numeric data types, nuances exist across different databases. Selecting the appropriate date-related data type depends on the data you need to store.
Currency
Many people use spreadsheets to manage their finances. Organizations typically use enterprise-scale software for the same purpose, with the data residing in a database. While financial data is numeric, people prefer seeing the numbers displayed as a specific currency. For example, consider the Number, Dollar, and Euro.
Strong And Weak Typing
Data types define values placed in columns. Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types. Databases, discussed in Chapter 3, use strong typing. A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values. You will get an error if you attempt to enter characters into a numeric column.Weak typing loosely enforces data types. Spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to accomplish their work. Spreadsheets default to an “automatic” data type and accommodate practically any value. When a person specifies a data type, it is loosely enforced compared to a database. For example, with a numeric spreadsheet cell, the software does not stop you from entering and storing characters.Software that uses weak typing can be helpful. That said, be mindful that you may experience unexpected and perhaps incorrect results.
Unstructured Data Types😏😏
While much of the data we use to record transactions is highly structured, most of the world's data is unstructured. Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses. Analyzing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight. Many people have camera-enabled smartphones, and using video for conversations and meetings is commonplace.
Binary
Binary data types are one of the most common data types for storing unstructured data. It supports any type of digital file you may have, from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to digital photographs. When considering which binary data type to use, file size tends to be the limiting factor. You need to select a data type that is as large as the largest file you plan on storing.
Audio
Audio data can come from a variety of sources. Whenever you interact with a customer service agent and hear “this call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes,” your conversation is probably being recorded and stored for later analysis. The impact of capturing, storing, and analyzing audio data has led to the development of avalanche detection systems. These systems listen for and detect the acoustic characteristics of an avalanche. With real-time notification capabilities, these systems reduce the time it takes for emergency services to respond and alert hikers to treacherous conditions.
Images
Image data can come from a variety of sources. People take more than 1 trillion photographs every calendar year, fuelled by the ubiquity of camera-enabled smartphones and relatively low storage costs. Each digital picture is a piece of unstructured data. 
Video
Video data is growing at a similar pace to image data. In the consumer space, people upload videos to YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok every day. Police officers wear body cameras to create a video record of enforcement situations. Image processing algorithms examine videos to detect everything from traffic congestion to intruders in the home.
Categories of Data😴😴
We try to fit data into structured and unstructured categories. The reality is that the world is not black and white, and not all data fits neatly into structured and unstructured categories. Semi-structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos.
Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data
Regardless of structure, data is either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data consists of numeric values. Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are quantitative.
Discrete vs. Continuous Data
Numeric data comes in two different forms: discrete and continuous. A helpful way to think about discrete data is that it represents measurements that can't be subdivided. You may intuitively think of discrete data as using whole numbers, but that doesn't have to be the case. For example, if a fundraising organization sells chickens in half-chicken increments, you can buy 1.5 chickens. However, you can't buy .25 chickens.
Categorical Data
In addition to quantitative, numeric data, there is categorical data. Text data with a known, finite number of categories is categorical. When considering an individual data element, it is possible to determine whether or not it is categorical. Let's continue to identify each data element of the pet dataset in Table 2.1. Animal Type is a good example of categorical data. As represented, this column separates the data into two categories: dog and cat. As additional dogs or cats enter into care, they fall within the existing categories.
Dimensional Data
Dimensional modeling is an approach to arranging data to facilitate analysis. Dimensional modeling organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables store measurement data that is of interest to a business. A veterinary practice may want to answer some questions about appointments. A table holding appointment data would be called a fact table. Dimensions are tables that contain data about the fact.
Common Data Structures🤖🤖
In order to facilitate analysis, data needs to be stored in a consistent, organized manner. When considering structured data, several concepts and standards inform how to organize data. On the other hand, unstructured data has a wider variety of storage approaches
Structured Data💀💀
Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent, defined manner, organized into columns and rows. Data is consistent when all entries in a column contain the same type of value. This method of organization facilitates aggregation. For example, you can add each value in the Weight column in Table 2.1 to get the total weight for all animals.
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/c6374470-6073-45a5-9c3b-4e756e9beed1)
Since both Pet Name and Animal Type are character data types, nothing from a structural standpoint prevents this mistake.Just as there is an expectation that the values in a given column are consistent, it is a convention that each row contains data about a single record.
Unstructured Data(●'◡'●)
Unstructured data is qualitative, describing the characteristics of an event or an object. Images, phrases, audio or video recordings, and descriptive text are all examples of unstructured data. There is very little that is common about different kinds of unstructured data. Since the data is highly variable, its organizational and storage needs are different from structured data. Unstructured data also represents a significant opportunity. A Forbes study shows that over 90 percent of businesses need to manage and derive value from unstructured data.A wide variety of technologies has emerged to facilitate the storage of unstructured data. Operationally, these technologies are similar to how a key in a tabular dataset identifies its associated values. With unstructured data, the key is a unique identifier, whereas the value is the unstructured data itself.Consider the log entry shown in Figure 2.22. As an example of machine data, it represents a single entry within a log file generated when accessing a specific image on the Internet. The log entry contains a mix of seemingly random strings, time stamps, IP addresses, URLs, and browser metadata.![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/73e66557-dcb7-4071-9bcf-1d9551fd24ef)
Semi-Structured Data😏😏
Semi-structured data is data that has structure and that is not tabular. Email is a well-known example of semi-structured data. Every email message has structural components, including recipient, sender, subject, date, and time. However, the body of an email is unstructured text, while attachments could be anything type of file.The need to make semi-structured data easier to work with has led to the emergence of semi-structured formatting options. These formatting options use separators or tags to provide some context around a data element. Let's explore common file formats for transporting semi-structured data.
Common File Formats🎈🎈
Common file formats facilitate data exchange and tool interoperability. Several file formats have emerged as standards and are widely adopted. As a modern data analyst, you will need to recognize all of these formats and be familiar with common use cases for each type.
Text Files🎆🎆
Text files are one of the most commonly used data file formats. As the name implies, they consist of plain text and are limited in scope to alphanumeric data. One of the reasons text files are so widely adopted is their ability to be opened regardless of platform or operating system without needing a proprietary piece of software.When machines generate data, the output is commonly stored in a text file. For example, the unstructured log entry. unique character known as a delimiter facilitates transmitting structured data via a text file. The delimiter is the character that separates individual fields. A delimiter can be any character. Over the years, the comma and tab grew into a widely accepted standard. Various software packages support reading and writing delimited files using the comma and the tab. In addition, many coding languages have libraries that make it easy to write comma- or tab-delimited files. When a file is comma-delimited, it is known as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Similarly, when a file is tab-delimited, it is called a tab-separated values (TSV) file.You may think that all CSV files represent structured data. Consider Figure 2.27, containing an excerpt from playback-related events from a Netflix viewer. Every column header except for Playtraces is structured. However, note the contents of the Playtraces field within the red rectangle.
Fixed-Width Files🧨🧨
Before it was common to use delimited files with variable-length columns, flat files were fixed-width, as illustrated in Figure 2.28. Fixed-width files are more laborious to create since they require a few extra steps.
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/b9d6e890-8b68-4f79-9e73-9073a15759df)
The first row in a fixed-width file describes the column names. For the data rows, you first need to determine the maximum length of each column. Then, you must pad values that are shorter than the maximum length. For numeric fields, you accomplish padding by prepending a leading zero. For alphanumeric or text fields, this is done by prepending or appending spaces.
JavaScript Object Notation✨✨
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open standard file format, designed to add structure to a text file without incurring significant overhead. One of its design principles is that JSON is easily readable by people and easily parsed by modern programming languages. Languages such as Python, R, and Go have libraries containing functions that facilitate reading and writing JSON files.To illustrate how a machine processes this same information, Figure 2.30 shows how the entire pet data, formatted as JSON, is read using the Python programming language. Figure 2.31 illustrates reading the same file using the R programming language. Note that R, which facilitates statistical analysis of data, has a summary command, the results of which illustrate some summary statistics about the pet data.
Extensible Markup Language (XML)🎄🎄
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that facilitates structuring data in a text file. While conceptually similar to JSON, XML incurs more overhead because it makes extensive use of tags. Tags describe a data element and enclose each value for each data element. While these tags help readability, they add a significant amount of overhead.In 1999, XML was the data format of choice and facilitated Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) web development techniques. AJAX allowed client applications, written in HTML, to retrieve data from a server asynchronously. Without having to wait for a server response, the speed with which dynamic web pages operated increased. With JSON as a lighter-weight alternative to XML, it is becoming increasingly popular when interacting asynchronously between a web browser and a remote server.
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)🎋🎋
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML pages serve as the foundation for how people interact with the World Wide Web. Similar to XML, HTML is a tag-based language. Figure 2.33 illustrates the creation of a table in HTML containing the data for a single pet. Figure 2.34 illustrates how a browser processes an HTML of fully populated pet data to display it to people.
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataAnalytics/assets/127289268/d2c28421-2451-4a2a-975a-70db983fae81)
Most people interact with HTML as interpreted by a web browser. HTML has become increasingly sophisticated over the years, with the ability for developers to create web pages that dynamically display content, adjust to different screen sizes, and play videos. Among the many tags that HTML supports is the image tag.
Chapter 2 Summary🎞🎞
When dealing with data, you need to think through the data values you are working with, because doing so influences your choice of data type. When using structured data, you may be working with dates, numbers, text, currency, or alphanumeric data. Whether the data is discrete, continuous, or categorical, choosing the appropriate data type can help boost data quality. There are also data types for storing unstructured data, such as images, audio, and video.If you are working with structured data, you should start thinking about it in a tabular fashion. Getting structured data into unique rows and consistent columns is the first step on the path to preparing data for analysis. Structured data fits well into CSV files, a popular format for exchanging data via flat files.When you have to incorporate additional metadata or represent a complex data structure, you need capabilities beyond what a flat-file provides. Formatting the data as JSON or XML is a viable alternative.
The modern analyst frequently works with data sources over the Internet. Understanding that HTML is the standard for structuring web pages is crucial to developing the ability to interact with data over the Internet programmatically.
